CloudFormation support for Visual Studio Code 

> **Note:** CloudFormation support works with YAML/JSON syntax selected or .json, .cform, .template file extensions. These are commonly used CloudFormation template extensions.

This extension has it's own syntax highlighting for .template files. 

Please note this is work in progress and may not be release ready but feel free to download the vsix plugin for VS Code.
